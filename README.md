I've been tinkering with Linux since 1996 and later in 2002 Solaris Unix scripting with the Korn Shell. 
In the last 7 years working with Linux professionally on database application backend support. 
I realized that I was limited in some areas so I completed the Linux Essentials certification from LPI and 
am studying for the next level certification LPIC-I. I also am an avid youtuber and follow several Linux channels. 
I am currently exploring DNS NFS and Bash shell scripting.
